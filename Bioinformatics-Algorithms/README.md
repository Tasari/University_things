# Bioinformatics Algorithms

Projects created to learn various algorithms and programming basics

## Project 1

Finds most frequent pattern of bases in the file  in C++ language  
Content:

* Reads data from file
* Counts the amount of occurances of given pattern
* Finds the most frequent pattern in file (Brute Force)
* Creates complementary sequence of given sequence

## Project 2

Project 1 rewritten using OOP with additional function finding 3 occurances in short distance in C++

## Project 3

Project 2 rewritten program based on modules with added skew diagram with matplotlib (Shows where should we look for most frequent patterns) in Python

## Project 4

3 miniprojects:

* Implementation of recursive and dynamic fibonnaci and comprasion of their speed in timeit
* Drawing the circle in cartesian and polar coordination system in matplotlib
* Creation of profile and getting most probable sequence based on profile, also measures standard deviation

## Project 5

Finding motifs (Sequences most similar to each other in all sequences), compares the Brute force, Greedy and random approach.

## Project 6

Implementation of python list based priority queue and Node based priority queue and comprasion of their speed in matplotlib using timeit

## Project 7

Comparing probability of survival of titanic catastrophe based on amount of money, age and sex using pandas and matplotlib
