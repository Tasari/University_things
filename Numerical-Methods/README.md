# Numerical methods

Programs created to solve mathematical problems

## NewtonArctan

Looks for root of ArcTan(2x)+c using newton method

## Zero-places

Looks for roots of given function using newton method, bisection method and fixed point method, then compares the amount of repeats it takes to find the root

## Chebyshev-interpolation

Interpolates the function using chebyshev interpolation

## Epidemy simulation

Program simulating the epidemy and drawing the graphs for it, includes many variables such as:  

1. Lose of immunity rate
2. Treating of ill
3. Chance of resistance to drug
4. Deaths and births
